## 8.1 - Create and Use Class

- By using class you can simulate almost everything
- a class is a template
- it stores the general structure of something

### 8.1.1 - Create Class

- `class class_name():`
- everything is defined by functions
- functions must include `self` as the first parameter
- `class_name` must be titled
- `__init__()`
- automatically called when a class is created
- `self.`

### 8.1.2 - Instantiate Class

- class is a general structure
- `object` is a specific example of a class
- it contains specific data
- `obj = Class(param)`
- attributes
  - use `object.attribute` to access an attribute
  - it shows that this attribute belongs to the object
- functions
  - to call functions that belong to the class
  - `.`
  - `object.function()`
- infinite number of instances can be created with one class
- all data stored in that instance only appears in that instance (scope)

## 8.2 - Use Class and Object

- OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- class is very commonly used
- after instantiating a class, you will also need to modify attributes to the class

### 8.2.1 - Default Value for Attributes

- not all attributes must be a parameter
- some don't need an argument for values
- defined in `__init__()`

### 8.2.2 - Default Values for Parameters

- just like normal functions, you can have param with default values

### 8.3.2 - Edit Value of Attribute

- there are three ways to edit a value
- edit the attribute directly
- use a function
- offset the value

1.  Edit the Value

- simple edit the attribute as how you would edit normal variables
- `obj.attr = val`

2.  Edit with a Method

- usually called an "update method"
- changes the value with a function
- it is sometimes a safer way to update
- more functionality to just edit

3.  offset value

- you can offset the values by adding a value to the attribute
- useful when you don't know the original data
- don't care about the original data
- difference is all that matters

## 8.3 - Inheritance

- Writing a class doesnâ€™t always have to start blank
- write a variation or special version of a preexisting class
- by inheriting a class, the child class contains everything the parent class has.
- a child class can then define and alter the original structure

### 8.3.1 - `__init__()` for child class

- the parent class must be accessible
- must be in front of child class
- child class must indicate the parent class
- `super().`
- anything in the parent class can be called with `super()`

### 8.3.2 - Add New Functions

- to add a new function that the parent class doesn't have, simply define it in the child class
- this only belongs to the child class
- parent class can't see these newly defined functions

### 8.3.3 - Overwrite Parent Functions

- the function has the same name as the one in the parent class
- use `super()` to reuse the code in the parent class and then write under it to add new features

### 8.3.4 - Instance as Attribute

- a feature of the class gets too complicated
- create an individual class
- save an instance with an attribute
- piecing pieces together just like the real world
- it is a better representation of the real-world object

## 9.4 - Import Class

- keep the main code file clean
- separate classes into files according to functionality

### 9.4.1 - import single class

- always write a comment on what the code does on the first line
- `from file_name import Class_name`
- then use it just like normal
- `Class_name.function()`

### import Multiple Classes

- when certain classes are closely related, they might be stored in the same file
- each file can store an infinite number of classes
- separate classes from the same file with a comma (`,`)
- `from module import Class1, Class2`

### 9.4.2 - Import the entire module

- to import everything in a module
- `module.class` to access class
- `module.class.function()`

### 9.4.3 - Import Every Class

- to import every class in a module
- `from module import *`
- `*` represents everything

### 9.4.4 - Chain Imports

- the module imported can also import other modules
- don't need to import the modules used in other modules

## 9.5 - Standard Library

- python has a set of standard functions and classes
- e.g. `OrderedDict`
- `orderedDict` functions just like a dictionary
- it also stores the order of the key-value pairs being added

## 9.6 - Class Code Style

- class names are conventionally named with "camel case"
- camel case means that the first letter of every word is capitalized
- there are no spaces or underscores present in the name
- instance names are all lowercase with each word separated with an underscore
